Start 11/02 finished and deployed 15/02
- The UI will be done using Sass with MaterialUI.
- The presentation is done in paper, the task is to replicate that.
- Fonts => ¿Combination of Inter 900-600 and Open Sans?
- Icons from FontAwesome

I will work with an API called CarsAPI https://carsapi1.docs.apiary.io/#reference/0/cars-collection/list-all-cars
which gets me: {
    "year": 2016,
    "id": 1,
    "horsepower": 201,
    "make": "acura",
    "model": "ilx",
    "price": 31890,
    "img_url": "http://ts2.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.M7656c6f6aaa4d51c3ddee4b1192adeeeH0&pid=15.1"
  },

-------------------

colors: { ✔️
  primary-blue: #075aff; 
    hover: #0053f7;
  secondary-orange: #F47C48
  secondary-yellow: #ffcf2e || #fdcf33 
}
fonts: { ✔️

Navbar : ✔️
  For the navbar i like the one who has https://www.webuycars.co.za/
  with an after that appears when hover.
  Then copy the schema made in paper.
    content: "";
    position: absolute;
    display: block;
    bottom: 0;
    left: 0;
    right: 0;
    height: 5px;
    background: #f47920;
    transition: -webkit-transform .2s ease-in-out;
    transition: transform .2s ease-in-out;
    transition: transform .2s ease-in-out,-webkit-transform .2s ease-in-out;
    -webkit-transform: scaleX(0);
    transform: scaleX(0);
    -webkit-transform-origin: right center;
    transform-origin: right center;

First Impression: ✔️
  A design was made on paper the idea is to replicate that.
  The design const of 2 parts, the written and informational
  and then the photo of a happy guy driving HD.

  The pair of buttons will have the following icon:
    <FontAwesomeIcon icon="fa-solid fa-car-side" />

How It Works: ✔️
  Next a mini-section of "How It Works" will be shown
  i will try to make very similar design as https://www.carsome.my/
  with a toggle button of "How to buy" & "...sell"

Plus:
Best sellers cars: 
  Next first impression will be displayed the most 4 sold out cars
  
* Pages
See all cars pages: ✔️
  Will have features like AutoTrader.com https://www.autotrader.com/cars-for-sale/all-cars/sedan/audi
  Because of the easy UI of filtering and displaying cars.
